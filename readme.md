INTRODUCTION

Network monitoring is a critical IT process where all networking components and hosts like routers, switches, firewalls and servers (both physical and virtual) are monitored for fault and performance and evaluated continuously to maintain and optimize their availability. One important aspect of network monitoring is that it should be proactive. Finding performance issues and bottlenecks proactively helps in identifying issues at the initial stage. Efficient proactive server monitoring can prevent network downtime or failures.

It is important to make sure the availability, performance, and health of networks over time. This can be done by network monitoring tools. With the help of the Network Monitoring Tool, IT Infrastructure Operations team gets complete visibility of the IT infrastructure all the time. These tools keep track of the network’s state in real-time, Identifies, and troubleshoots problems before affecting the end-users. There are some factors while choosing Network Monitoring Tools.

We are using a tool called Zabbix . It’s an open-source Network monitoring tool. The Zabbix solution exposes the administrative tasks through a web interface, however, there is a limitation of role based access control where different profiled users can be granted permissions to perform a subset of administrative actions.
The solution that is proposed through this project is to provide a NOC workspace extending the RBAC capabilities required to manage the administrative actions on the Zabbix monitoring platform.

OBJECTIVE
• Assist in smooth migration from legacy tool to open-source tool.
• It will provide a Network Operation Control (NOC) Workspace, enabling a NOC Engineer to execute
regular admin action on nodes and applications monitor from console within the scope of project.
• To provide Role Based Access Control (RBAC) on the Zabbix platform.
• To provide a single work window for NOC engineers to configure monitoring, maintain their monitoring status and generate trend reports with historical data.
